                <p class="pera">An Eustachian tube blockage is one possible cause of a clogged ear. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the throat. Fluid and mucus flows from the ear to the back of the throat through this tube, where it’s swallowed.

                    But instead of flowing down the throat, fluid and mucus can sometimes become trapped in the middle ear and clog the ear. This blockage usually accompanies an infection, such as the common cold, influenza, or sinusitis. Allergic rhinitis can also cause a blockage in the Eustachian tube.</p>

                <p class="pera">Some people experience temporary ear clogging while scuba diving, driving up a mountain, or flying in an airplane. A rapid change in air pressure outside the body causes this blockage.

                    The Eustachian tube is responsible for equalizing pressure in the middle ear. But at higher altitudes, it can’t always equalize pressure properly. As a result, the change in air pressure is felt in the ears. A clogged ear is sometimes the only side effect of an altitude change. If you develop high altitude sickness, you may also have a headache, nausea, or shortness of breath.</p>

                <p class="pera">Earwax protects your ear by cleansing the ear canal and preventing debris from entering the ear. Wax is normally soft, but it can harden and cause a blockage in the ear. When earwax triggers a clogged ear, other symptoms may include:

                    an earache
                    ringing in the ears
                    dizziness
                    Using a cotton swab to clean inside the ear is sometimes responsible for these blockages. Cotton swabs shouldn’t be placed inside of the ear. This method of cleaning can push earwax deeper into the ear.</p>

                <p class="pera">Acoustic neuroma is a benign growth that develops on the cranial nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. These tumors are usually slow-growing and small. However, as they become larger, they can put pressure on nerves in the inner ear. This can cause a clogged ear, hearing loss, and a ringing in the ear.</p>
