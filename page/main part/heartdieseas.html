                <p class="pera">Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart disease.

                    It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged with plaque. This causes them to harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol and other substances.
                    
                    As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients. In time, the heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.
                    
                    When plaque builds up in the arteries, it is called atherosclerosis. Plaque in the arteries can rupture from blockages and cause blood flow to stop, which can lead to a heart attack.</p>

                <p class="pera">A person with a congenital heart defect is born with a heart problem. There are many types of congenital heart defects, includingTrusted Source:

                    Atypical heart valves: Valves may not open properly, or they may leak blood.
                    Septal defects: There is a hole in the wall between either the lower chambers or the upper chambers of the heart.
                    Atresia: One of the heart valves is missing.
                    Congenital heart disease can involve major structural issues, such as the absence of a ventricle or problems with unusual connections between the main arteries that leave the heart.</p>

                <p class="pera">Arrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeatTrusted Source. It occurs when the electrical impulses that coordinate the heartbeat do not work correctly. As a result, the heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or erratically.

                    There are various types of arrhythmias, including:
                    
                    Tachycardia: This refers to a rapid heartbeat.
                    Bradycardia: This refers to a slow heartbeat.
                    Premature contractions: This refers to an early heartbeat.
                    Atrial fibrillation: This is a type of irregular heartbeat.
                    A person may notice a feeling like a fluttering or a racing heart</p>

            <div class="part">
                <p class="pera">This condition usually develops when a genetic problem affects the heart muscle. It tends to be an inherited condition.

                    The walls of the muscle thicken, and contractions become harder. This affects the heartâ€™s ability to take in and pump out blood. In some cases, an obstruction can occur.
                    
                    There may be no symptoms, and many people do not receive a diagnosis. However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can worsen over time and lead to various heart problems.
                    
                    Anyone with a family history of this condition should ask for screening, as receiving treatment can help prevent complications.
                    
                    Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the main cause of cardiac deathTrusted Source among young people and athletes under 35 years old, according to the AHA.</p>
