                <p class="pera">Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.

                    Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
                    
                    Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.

                <p class="pera">Psoriasis on the face is different than on other parts of the body. Your skin there is thinner and may be more sensitive to treatments. In this area, the condition usually affects your:
                    
                    Eyebrows
                    Skin between your nose and upper lip
                    Upper forehead
                    Hairline
                    You have a lot of options for treating psoriasis in these areas. Work closely with your doctor to find what works best for you.
                    
                    Symptoms
                    They vary depending on what part of your face the psoriasis affects:
                    
                    Eyelids
                    
                    Scales cover the lashes.
                    The edges of your lids may get red and crusty.
                    The rims may turn up or down if they’re inflamed for a long time.
                    Eyes
                    
                    Dry, inflamed, irritated eyes
                    Trouble seeing
                    Ears
                    
                    Scales build up and can block your ear canal, causing hearing loss.
                    Usually, psoriasis doesn’t affect the inner ear.
                    Mouth
                    
                    You might have white and gray lesions:
                    
                    On your gums or tongue
                    Inside the cheek
                    Inside your nose
                    On the lips

                <p class="pera">Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. It's common in children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare periodically. It may be accompanied by asthma or hay fever.
                    
                    No cure has been found for atopic dermatitis. But treatments and self-care measures can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks. For example, it helps to avoid harsh soaps, moisturize your skin regularly, and apply medicated creams or ointments.
                    Atopic dermatitis (eczema) signs and symptoms vary widely from person to person and include:
                    
                    Dry skin
                    Itching, which may be severe, especially at night
                    Red to brownish-gray patches, especially on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, inside the bend of the elbows and knees, and in infants, the face and scalp

            <div class="part">
                <p class="pera">It affects roughly 6.8 million people in the United States.
                    
                    In the majority of cases, hair falls out in small patches around the size of a quarter. For most people, the hair loss is nothing more than a few patches, though in some cases it can be more extreme.
                    
                    Sometimes, it can lead to the complete loss of hair on the scalp (alopecia totalis) or, in extreme cases, the entire body (alopecia universalis).
                    
                    The condition can affect anyone regardless of age and gender, though most cases occur before the age of 30.
                    In this article, we look at the causes and symptoms of alopecia areata, its diagnosis, and potential treatments.
