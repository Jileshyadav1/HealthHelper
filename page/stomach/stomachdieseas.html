              <p class="pera">The gallbladder is a small sac that stores bile, which the body uses during digestion. Gallstones are small stones that form in the gallbladder.

                In most cases, a person may not know that they have gallstones, as they usually do not produce any symptoms. However, people may experience symptoms if the gallstones form in front of an opening in the gallbladder.</p>

                <p class="pera">Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that causes the body to attack the intestinal lining if a person eats foods containing gluten.

                    Unlike non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease is a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines if left untreated.
                    
                    Symptoms of celiac disease can includeTrusted Source:
                    
                    long-term diarrhea
                    constipation
                    stools that are pale, that are smellier than usual, and that float
                    abdominal pain</p>

                <p class="pera">Doctors may begin trying to diagnose a digestive condition by performing a physical examination and asking questions about an individual’s symptoms and medical history. For example, a doctor may ask about:

                    medications a person takes
                    their diet and lifestyle
                    whether any relatives have digestive conditions
                    They may then proceed to order tests such as:
                    
                    blood tests, which may help detect celiac disease, inflammation, or signs of infection</p>

                <p class="pera">Achalasia is a rare condition that typically affects adults aged 25–60 years. It occurs when the esophagus loses the ability to move food toward the stomach, and the valve at the end may fail to open.

                    the sensation while eating that food is not “going down”
                    heartburn
                    regurgitation of food
                    coughing or choking during sleep
