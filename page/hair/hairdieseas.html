                <p class="pera">Some people consider gray hair as something that makes them look distinguished; for others, it's a reminder that they're getting older. How ever you feel about it, gray or white hair is pretty much inevitable with age (if you're fortunate enough to still have hair in your later years).

                    Scientists have put a lot of effort into investigating the cause of gray hair, and they believe they've gotten to the root of the problem. Hair gets its color from a pigment called melanin, which is produced by melanocyte cells in the hair follicles. Researchers have discovered that melanocytes endure cumulative damage over the years, which eventually leaves them unable to produce melanin</p>

                <p class="pera">Normally, hair goes through a regular growth cycle. During the anagen phase, which lasts two to six years or longer, the hair grows. During the telogen phase, which lasts about three months, the hair rests. At the end of the telogen phase, the hair falls out and is replaced by new hair.

                    The average person loses about 100 hairs each day. Hair loss also can have other causes, including drugs or disease.
                    
                    As they age, men tend to lose the hair on top of their head, which eventually leaves a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair around the sides. This type of hair loss is called male-pattern baldness. It's caused by genes</p>

                <p class="pera">Blow-drying, straightening, highlighting, and perming regularly can wreak havoc on hair, leaving it brittle, broken, and unmanageable. Split ends and dry hair are just two casualties of overstyling.

                    Excessive styling and heat can cause split ends, which occur when the protective outermost layer of hair (the cuticle) is damaged and peels back. Some treatments for split ends include:
                    
                    Brush gently with a soft, flexible hairbrush; don't overbrush.
                    Avoid towel-drying. If you do dry your hair with a towel, rub it gently.
                    Use a conditioner, and leave on a deep conditioner about once a week</p>

                <p class="pera">The scalp contains a natural oil called sebum, which helps keep the skin lubricated. Sebum is produced by the sebaceous glands. Sometimes these glands work overtime and produce too much oil, leading to a greasy scalp. Greasy hair can look dull, limp, and lifeless, and it may be more difficult to manage. To treat greasy hair, try washing with a gentle shampoo that is specially formulated to control sebum.</p>
